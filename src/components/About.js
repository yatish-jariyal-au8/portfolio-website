            Hi, I'm Yatish and I'm a Fullstack developer, I usually work with
            the MERN stack, but I also love to code in Python. I'm a Computer
            Engineering dropout, so I have learned most of the programming
            languages myself. Apart from creating web applications, solving
            interesting coding problems gives me a brain rush, never fails to
            amaze. Coding stuff aside I spend my time playing or watching
            football (Not the one played with hands!), watching movies,
            listening to music, mostly Pink Floyd and occasional camping.
          </p>
